# Introduction
Surprisingly, software is one of the first industries to experience transformation by AI technology. Everyone's what-would-be future was machine taking over manual labor, not knowledge work. But as we stand here in the wake of ChatGPT's disruptive release in December 2021, Software building has changed forever. Constant layoffs plus hire freezes have left the industry bleeding which has left a bitter taste in the mouth for many. *Add stats*

These things certainly add to the negative perception of AI, in software but also in other fields. I think this hate for AI arises from multiple factors. One of them is losing our current routine, and the work we love. Work is a big part of our identity, and it is natural to feel scared when it is threatened. This is the duality of AI. For one, it is magical as it helps them create pictures, videos, music, etc. instantaneously, anything they could dream of, but for another, it is soulless mimicry of the real art. The art in which they put their blood, sweat and tears into, this long and tedious process which was a part of their daily routine, a source for passion and fulfillment. When the machine does that work effortlessly and endlesly, it raises some difficult existential questions, ignoring the unethical collection of data. At least as softwware engineers, our work is not as creative as artists or graphic designers. I may not have all the answers but the quote "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change", attributed to Charles Darwin, is a good reminder to keep up with the ever-evolving tools and technologies. All we can do is adapt. For now however, I think AI is not a replacement but here to push our limits.

This transformation isn't just changing how we code but also what it means to be a software engineer. I argue that memorizing syntax is no longer one of the goals of engineering, but knowing what you can plan and achieve with the tools at your disposal is. You are no longer the junior dev, AI is, you are in charge of one. We will go over some of tips and resources to help you navigate the changing tide to your favor. 

# AI Usage Philosophy and coding tips
Ensure modularity, readability, security and simplicity. Keep principles like SOLID, DRY(Donâ€™t repeat yourself), KISS (Keep It Short And Simple) and SoC (Separation of Concerns) to create a quality product that can be iterated on and stand longer than 5 prompts. Gen AI is great to test out MVP's, prototype initial ideas and handle all the boilerplate stuff so you can devote your energy to maximize impact to drive business innovation. The days of lorem-ipsum are in past. Populating with relevant demo data has never been simple.

Make sure the architecture is sound from the start so that maintaining it in the future is achievable for both you and your LLM partner. Treat your AI as a new-grad -- enthusiastic, full of knowledge but lacking the bigger context. In AI it is often said context is king. A lot of work has recently gone into provide AI better context of your code such as agentic mode, semantic search, file access and MCP tools. All of this can be seen in IDE's like Cursor, Windsurf and Visual studio. However it is still prone to hallucinations (making stuff up) and mistakes. 

Great models are not enough these days, the ecosystem is around it. Copying code from chatbot online is not a bad idea, but it is not effective or efficient. The agentic workflows in latest IDE's are a game-changer. They are tightly integrated with your working environment and provide better context to the LLM. They allow you to make the changes in real-time, which you may accept, reject or modify right there. They can search the filesystem, create new files, and even run commands. This is a huge powerup than just chatting. Other best AI tools are also more than chatbots or raw models. 

Prompting the LLM is a challenge in itself. Prompt engineering is the art of designing instructions to get desired outputs. And believe me, instructing in a clear, concise way is a lot harder than you think. As humans we assume a lot about the knowledge of others around us so the instructions are not detailed. I love this playful video that gets the point across [Exact Instructions Challenge for Peanut Butter Sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8&ab_channel=JoshDarnit). For example while you're building with your copilot you may decide to change your approach in the middle of development. If you do not ask explicitly it may leave some dead code from the previous attempt which will bloat your codebase, making it difficult to navigate and understand. In general be explicit about your objectives, sometimes it is even a good idea to fine-tune your prompt using AI before execution example - "Help me plan how to add an about page without making any changes."

Mastery of source control is essential to not lose valuable progress or I may come across another post 'AI destroyed months of my work'. It is better to build iteratively step by step achieving one goal at a time. Test out your changes to make sure they work as expected, review for clean code, then stage our commit your changes before proceeding to improve or build another feature. We don't play games without checkpoints and neither should we code without them.

Do not let AI to completely take over the project. Use it as a tool to fill gaps between your knowledge and hasten the development process. Ask it why something is done if you're not sure, you may want to look it up yourself if dubious because it may be spitting nonsense. Microsoft named it perfectly by calling it copilot -- that means you're still in charge.

Use MCP tools which can be described as extensions for LLM models to push their limits. Some of the simple ones I like for my Windsurf IDE are sequential-thinking and memory by Anthropic. These tools help LLM plan by breaking down the requirement into various branches and also store important information over multiple chats. You may check my previous article for more comprehensive details about MCP tools [here](https://gmakkar.ca/blog/mcp-tools). 

Document your project properly describing the structure, how to run, .env.example file, debugging tips etc. in the README.md. This is historically one of the most neglected and underrated process of software development. It will save you a lot of sweat and pain when you're coming back to your project 3 months later.

Keep your chats small and focused on particular or related topics. Chatbots remember the current session's chat history which can overload the context window making the response more prone to hallucinations. If you know the file that needs to be created or edited, mention it and reference it directly to save your precious resources (usually done by @file-name or @method-name). Breaking complex talks into actionable steps will provide better  results.

If a file starts to get too big, it is time to chop it down and refactor properly. SoC will help you and the bot to read your code faster from a high-level perspective and scoping to the appropriate class which has the issue will lead to easier bug fixes. Tech that grows exponentially when not addressed.

For complex issues, if fixing with AI, ask it to investigate the issue first before choosing the path to fix based on the analysis. Sometimes, AI's solutions are not optimal for the larger picture. Take a pause and understand what is best for you at a project and architecture level before moving forward. AI is great for code analysis or investigating unkown or forgetten parts.

Continuous learning to keep up with ever-evolving tools and technologies is key. If you do not know the full capabilities of the tools, you may be implementing suboptimal solutions. AI may not be fully up to date with the latest trends and best practices either due to knowlefge cut offs or the training data not containing sufficient examples of the best practices.

Generate tests and test cases for your application to avoid breaking changes. Remember to update them promptly and run them often to catch any issues early. Test driven development (TDD) is a good practice to follow, to produce a stable and reliable codebase. In TDD, you write tests before writing the code. 

Starting with zero trust system is a better idea for working with AI. AI works great in some areas but that is not always the case. Start slowly, review the changes suggested before proceeding. Review the code of AI, just as in any other person. Make small edits or leave TODO comments to guide the AI further. Do not let the Review debt accumulate to unsustainable levels. The quote by Benjamin Franklin should be wisely heeded -- "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

I do want to highlight that mediocrity is not always bad, whatever my or yours inner perfectionist may say. Not everything needs to be 100% optimized, but it is important to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. Sometimes, good enough is good enough. We want to spend our valuable time on things that have the most impact, AI gives us that opportunity. Mediocirty asidew, we can't have a terrible mess at our hands if we have any long term plans. While AI is providing us immense productivity gains, it also has downsides. Besides taking over social media feeds, with fake news, and endless brain rot, it can also decay our codebase. 

Over reliance on AI can diminish our critical and creteive thinking according to a recent study by [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1). This makes sense as usually described by the phrase "Use it or lose it". We need to keep our wits sharp and delegating all the tasks to AI without proper review and analysis decreases brain engagement required to stay sharp. While learning is easier than ever before with AI, so is cheating. The best way to use AI is by being engaged and curious, at least for the core parts of your job. 

AI is biased and is an image of people who trained it. Data can be cherry picked and behavior can be tuned post-training to mirror the identity and beliefs of the people who trained it. Do not take AI as the source of truth. This may not always directly affect the code but talking with it may effect your thoughts and decisions. AI bots can be used to spread propaganda and fake news. Recently X AI's Grok caused some headlines by steering seemingly unreleated conversations to the topic of 'white genocide'. [This](https://umbc.edu/stories/groks-white-genocide-responses-show-how-generative-ai-can-be-weaponized/) is just a small example. There can be other very subtle ways AI can manipulate our thoughts and decisions without us even realizing it. I would like to disucss this more in depth in a future article.

Recently security researchers found that hackers are taking advantage of AI hallucinations to sneak malicious packages into our code. Some of the common hallucinated package names have been downloading thousands of time, highlighting the magnitude of the issue.

# Resources to level up

# What happens when Copilot becomes the Pilot?
So far, AI has been playing on the turf of humans. The IDE's for example are created for human use, not AI. A lot of tools have been created for AI to have easier access to same tools as us but it is still a work in progress. Besides this AI is still not as smart as humans for general tasks across a range of domains needing interaction with different environments and tools, even though it may be smarter in terms raw knowledge. There will, none the less, be a point where AI will be the Pilot. It is a question of when, not if. When the day comes, we will have to adapt to survive this new reality. Adapting well to it will help us thrive.
